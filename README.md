# machine_learning

A classic, custom built neural net to identify numbers in images. 

Environment setup:

1) download project zip or clone the repo in a local <project root> directory
2) have python3 installed, preferably with IDLE too.
3) install packages 'numpy' and 'matplotlib' for python3

Project setup:

1) unzip the mnist_train_images.zip file, and make sure the '.npy' files: "mnist_train_images.npy" , "mnist_train_images.npy" ,"mnist_test_images.npy", "mnist_test_labels.npy", "mnist_validation_images.npy", "mnist_validation_images.npy", 
are in the same directory as the "neural_net_mnist.py" python file.

2) run the python file from IDLE ('Run module'), and wait for the tuning to finish before the testing starts.

3) The final testing accuracy must be above 95% or 0.95. The program shouls print:

"Accuracy on the testing set:  0.9711"


TODO List:

- add option to pass single image as input in the trained algorithm to identify it.
